# ITPP Runbot

Docker based runbot-like solution for odoo addons repositories.

Features:

* Allows preview updates
* Runs tests
* Provides instructions to reproduce errors locally by using same docker images and volumes
* Uses Github tools: 

  * *Github Actions* to build docker images
  * *Github Packages* to store docker images

* Tests in pull-requests are run in private server, cause *Github Actions*'
  environment doesn't have access to external resources (e.g. to s3 to upload
  docker volumes). This part of the system is proprietary.
